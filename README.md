# Merv Antonio Code Louisville Project

## Purpose:
<p>This is a travel album website.  I wanted to create a lightbox for the photos, but couldn't figure it out, so I linked it to an Imgur site instead.  The website is not hosted, so the contact sheet is not linked to anything.  All the other links are live an active</p>

## CSS and JavaScript:
<p>I have a separate CSS and JavaScript file.  My JavaScript is the random quote generator.</p>
